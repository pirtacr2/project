  <h1>Brief History of Football</h1>
    <div class="content">
    <p>Cuju was a second century (BC) Chinese ball game that involved kicking. A football version was played around a square field using a large, round ball that contained fur or even feathers inside the stitches along its outer layers. In its modified version, it spread to Japan as a religious exercise called kemari.

    <p>A later version of the game was created in England in the 12th century. This century saw football-like games being played on English fields and roads. The other thing about football at the time was that it allowed fists rather than just kicks. The ancient version of football was much rougher and brute than how it is nowadays.

    <p>As football spread in many locations worldwide, It became very popular. In fact, in the 16th century, in Florence, Italy, the game had to be banned because it would cause too much chaos in towns and in some extreme cases, there were deaths relating to this game. Football would then return in the 17th century, but it was banned again in 1835. However, the game was already popular in many parts of the world.

    <p>It took, however, a long time until the features of todayâ€™s football had been taken into practice. For a long time there was no clear distinction between football and rugby. There were also many variations concerning the size of the ball, the number of players and the length of a match. The game was often played in schools and two of the predominant schools were Rugby and Eton. At Rugby the rules included the possibility to take up the ball with the hands and the game we today know as rugby has its origin from here. At Eton on the other hand the ball was played exclusively with the feet and this game can be seen as a close predecessor to modern football.

    <p>The sport was at first an entertainment for the British working class. Unprecedented amounts of spectators, up to 30,000, would see the big matches in the late 19th century. The game would soon be expanded by British people who travelled to other parts of the world and as a result of the British colonisation efforts. Especially in South America and India would the interest in football become big.
