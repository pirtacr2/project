        <h2>Offside</h2>
        <p>
    
The offside law (Law 11) is the most argued-over law wherever in the world the game of football is played, even though it’s pretty simple. Here’s how it works.
A player is caught offside if he’s nearer to the opponents’ goal than both the ball and the second-last opponent when his team-mate plays the ball. In other words, a player can’t receive the ball from a team-mate unless there are at least two players either level with him or between him and the goal.
It is not an offence in itself to be offside. A player is only penalised for being offside if he is deemed to be involved in active play. So a player can only be called offside if he is:
        </p>
        <p>In the opposition’s half.
            Interfering with play (that is, he’s part of the attacking move).
            Interfering with an opponent (that is, he’s preventing the opponent from defending against the attacking move).
            Gaining any advantage by being in that position.
            </p>
            <h2>Addition rules:</h2>
            <p>A player cannot be offside from a goal kick, throw in or corner
                A player cannot be offside when standing in his own half or on the half-way line.
                When considering offside, referees look for only heads and feet, not arms or hands, as these are parts of your body you cannot score with.
                A player who is in an offside position but does not interfere with play is not punished.

                <p>1. **Substitutions:**
                    - Substituting a player allows you to change tactics or replace an underperforming player.
                    - Once a player is substituted, they cannot return to the game.
                    - You can substitute any player, and it doesn't have to be in the same position.
                    - For an offensive push, you might replace a defender with an attacking player.
                 
                 2. **Goalkeeper Substitution:**
                    - If your goalkeeper is injured or receives a red card, substitute an outfield player with the secondary goalkeeper.
                 
                 
                 3. **Free Kicks:**
                    - There are two types: direct and indirect.
                    - Direct allows a clear shot at goal, while indirect requires touching the ball first.
                    - Indirect free kicks can result from offenses like dangerous play, impeding without physical contact, or offensive language.
                 
                 4. **Free Kicks in the Penalty Area:**
                    - Indirect free kicks can occur inside the penalty area.
                    - Not every foul leads to a penalty; common instances include a defender passing back to the goalkeeper using hands or the keeper holding the ball for more than six seconds.
                 
                 5. **Drop Ball:**
                    - Occurs after an injury on the field.
                    - Usually happens after collisions resulting in free kicks or penalties.
                    - In case of an unnoticed injury, players are encouraged to kick the ball out, allowing medics to attend to the injured player.
                    - Note: This is a goodwill gesture and not a strict rule; some teams may continue play even with an injured player on the field.
