        <h2>Basic Rules</h2>
        <p>This is what a regular football pitch looks like. It is made up of a centre circle, and two penalty boxes at either end of the field. In each penalty box is a penalty spot and what is called a 6-yard box. Not all pitches are the same size, but the length of the pitch must be between 90m and 120m, and the width between 45m and 90m. The penalty box is approximately 16m by 40m, and the center circle has a radius of about 9m. There is a set of goalposts at either end of the field, with the penalty spot being 11m (12yds) directly in front of them</p>
        <p>The main objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by kicking the ball into their goal while also defending your own. Players can pass the ball to teammates anywhere on the field and are permitted to run with the ball, a distinction from some other sports. There are a few rules governing passing. The first is the offside rule, which we'll discuss later. Another rule pertains to passing back to the goalkeeper. If you use your feet to pass the ball to the goalkeeper, he must also play it with his feet. However, if you use your head to return the ball to him, he is then allowed to pick it up.</p>
            </div>
            <ul class="rules">
<!-- <li>The ball is kicked off from the centre spot at the start of each half and after a team scores. Up until recently, you had to initially pass the ball forwards before passing it backwards, but it is no longer the case.
</li>
<li>No players can be in the opposition half when kick-off occurs.</li>     
<li>Any foul can result in a free kick, or a penalty if the foul takes place in the penalty area. There can be free-kicks in the area as well under the right circumstance.
</li>
<li>If the attacking team kicks the ball beyond the goal line, this results in a goal kick. If the defending team kicks it behind their own line, the attackers are awarded a corner kick.
</li>
<li>Tackling is the skill of taking the ball away from the players’ feet. What’s important when you tackle is that you touch the ball. If you make contact with the player rather than the ball, that is a foul. Be careful when you tackle, as keeping both your feet in the air when you lunge can result in hurting another player. Do not elbow, tug on shirts or push the player, as that again would result in a foul.</li>
    <li>A goal kick must be taken on the edge of the 6-yard box, but can be taken by either a defender or the goalkeeper. A corner kick is taken by the attacking side, where the ball is placed in a corner, where there is a small quarter-circle.
    </li>   
    <li>There are various types of fouls, but here are some examples of play to avoid.
    </li>
    <li>Dangerous Challenges: Even if you don’t make contact with anyone, a referee might call for a free kick.
    </li>
    <li>Handball: You can touch the ball with your feet, head, chest, thighs and even shoulder, but it cannot touch any part of your arm.</li>
<li>Diving/Simulation: If you pretend you were fouled, then referees are allowed to call a free kick against you.</li>
<li>Being offside: Not a foul you will be booked for, but it will result in a free kick for the other team.
</li>
<li>Physical violence: Starting or participating in any sort of fight (even if you didn’t start it) could result in a form of punishment from the referee.</li>
<li>Foul throw: This is another non-bookable foul, and is an easy one to avoid. When you throw the ball in from the sidelines, keep the ball behind your head before you throw the ball, and make sure not to drop the ball at your own feet.
</li>
<li>If you break these rules, referees are allowed to book you. If a player commits what the referee thinks is a serious infringement, the referee can show the player a yellow or red card. A yellow card is a warning known as a booking, and if the same player commits an offense that the referee thinks deserves a second yellow card, that player is also shown a red card. A red card means an immediate dismissal from the match, and your team now has to play with fewer players.</li>
