  <h1>Progression of Rules
</h1>
    <div class="content">
    <h2>Pre 1863:</h2>
        <p> In the nineteenth century, there were numerous football games where people would try to put the ball inside the opponentâ€™s target. The first edition rules of football at rugby school (1845) allowed plenty of handling, only to be shortly succeeded by those much stricter for the eton field game (1847).

    <h2>1863:</h2>
    <p>The final version of the FA's laws was formally adopted and published in December 1863. Some notable differences from the modern game are listed below:
    </p>
    <ul class="content-list">
        <li>There was no crossbar. Goals could be scored at any height (as today in Australian rules football).</li>
        <li>While most forms of handling were forbidden, players were allowed to catch the ball (provided they did not run with it or throw it). A fair catch was rewarded with a free kick (a feature that today survives in various forms in Australian rules football, rugby union and American football).
        </li>
        <li>There was a strict offside rule, under which any player ahead of the kicker was in an offside position (similar to today's offside rule in rugby union). The only exception was when the ball was kicked from behind the goal line.
        </li>
        <li>The throw-in was awarded to the first player (on either team) to touch the ball after it went out of play. The ball had to be thrown in at right-angles to the touchline (as today in rugby union).
        </li>
        <li>There was no corner-kick. When the ball went behind the goal-line, there was a situation somewhat similar to rugby: if an attacking player first touched the ball after it went out of play, then the attacking team had an opportunity to take a free kick at goal from a point fifteen yards behind the point where the ball was touched (somewhat similar to a conversion in rugby). If a defender first touched the ball, then the defending team kicked the ball out from on or behind the goal line (equivalent to the goal-kick).
        </li>
        <li>Teams changed ends every time a goal was scored.
        </li>
        <li>The rules made no provision for a goal-keeper, match officials, punishments for infringements of the rules, duration of the match, half-time, number of players, or pitch-markings (other than flags to mark the boundary of the playing area).
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Rules Today</h2>
        <ul class="content-list">
            <li>There is a crossbar, and sending the ball over it results in a corner kick. The crossbar is 2.44 metres in height.
            </li>
            <li>Making ball contact with the arm is forbidden, the only exception is for goalkeepers, when they are in their own box.
            </li>
            <li>
                You are allowed to kick the ball forward, however the offside rule still exists, but it is different to how it was in 1863.    
            </li>
            <li>
                When a team sends the ball out of play, the opposing team is awarded a throw in. Another change is that the ball can be thrown at any angle. Also, the offside rule doesn't count in a throw in.  
            </li>
            <li>Corner kick now exists and is awarded when the opposing team sends the ball behind their own goal line (not in the goal).
            </li>
            <li>Teams only change sides after half time, (and extra time along with half time at extra time if it is a cup match). Never after goals.
            </li>
            <li>Goal-keepers, match officials, punishments for infringements of the rules, duration of the match, half-time, number of players, and pitch-markings are all strictly enforced nowadays in football.
            </li>
            </ul>
