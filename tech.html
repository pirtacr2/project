    <h2>Modern Football:</h2>
    <p>The introduction of VAR (Video assistant referee) in March 2018 has caused a lot of controversy in recent years due to controversial decisions. However, VAR has contributed a lot to football since its introduction. Its purpose is to “operate under the philosophy of "minimal interference, maximum benefit"”. VAR is used in all main top flight leagues around the world.

    <p>A modern ball is an inflated spherical piece of rubber with an air valve covered in various materials of the manufacturer's choice.

    <p>The ball is kicked throughout the whole game of football, and because the ball is inflated it makes the ball softer, lighter, and more durable than the older ones- and allows the player to kick with strength without injuring themselves.

    <p>Major manufacturers of footballs include Adidas and Nike. Nike currently supplies the official ball of the Premier League which is called the Nike Flight, which succeeded the Nike Merlin back in the 2020/21 season.
