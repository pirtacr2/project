        <h1>Money over Passion</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the early times of football, icons such as Diego Maradona, Eusébio da Silva Ferreira and arguably the best player of all time Pele have been looked at as legends and not for the amount of money they have earned through playing football but for their spectacular talent on the pitch, their love and passion for the sport of football and also their desire to win and to be the greatest! But things have changed juristically over the years as many players are now looking at the sport as more of a job rather than for the passion and strive for greatness. Big players such as Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema who use to play for passion rather than money have been seen going overseas to leagues such as the Saudi and MLS leagues purely for the huge incentives that come with them as all of these players are earning over a whopping £200 million pound! As a result players nowadays are just playing the sport for the incentives that come with it like sponsors etc. This is due to the massive increase in wages over the years and sum of the amounts being paid are unbelievable.<br>
                
 
 
 
 
                The differences in wealth across clubs are a major factor in peoples decision to prioritize money over passion
                Elite teams that are supported by wealthy owners or are experiencing significant commercial success may be able to provide enormous wages and bonuses that exceed those of smaller clubs.<br>
                Some athletes put money above staying at a club where their love of the game first took off when presented with the chance to dramatically enhance their financial situation. This change has also been influenced by the power of agents and the commercialization of football.<br>
                Agents frequently support moves that offer higher financial rewards since they are motivated by financial incentives associated with player transfers and contracts.
                This kind of influence can change a player's mind, making them prioritize financial gain over any sentimental ties they may have to a specific team.|<br>
                In addition, the fleeting nature of a football player's career encourages a rush to maximize profits in a comparatively brief playingcareer.A player's career path may be impacted by unforeseen injury, performance, or club changes. As a result, the desire to close a profitable deal which is frequently viewed as a kind of security becomes increasingly strong.<br>
